## bGPT: from Language Models to Byte Models

Byte models extend traditional language models to the byte level, treating all digital data and operations as fundamentally byte-based. These models process data from different modalities (such as text, image, and audio) uniformly as bytes, making them versatile in a wide digital environment. However, recent research on byte models has been limited, with a focus on narrow tasks. These studies often overlook the broader potential of byte models in the digital world simulation.

*[Figure 1](https://byte-gpt.github.io/): The bGPT framework simulates digital systems using native binary data. It integrates diverse data types into a single model by treating everything as a byte sequence.*

To address this issue, the authors proposed bGPT, which is designed for modeling digital data at byte-level. It performs comparably to specialized models across various well-studied modalities, and opens up new possibilities for simulating algorithm and hardware operations. By learning to predict next byte, bGPT provides a deeper understanding of the intricate patterns in the digital world.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

- **bGPT**, a model with *next-byte prediction* is presented to simulate digital systems
- **Hierarchical Transformer architecture** is adapted to handle byte sequences efficiently.
- **In-depth analysis** of bGPT's performance on text, audio, and image data is provided.
- **Novel benchmarks** are introduced to show bGPT's capabilities for digital world simulation.

*[Figure 2](https://byte-gpt.github.io/): The hierachical Transformer architecture of bGPT. It segments sequence of bytes into a sequence of patches, to balance the need for long sequences and computational efficiency.*

Learning patterns in digital systems at the byte level provides a unified approach to integrating various data types, but the high resolution of bytes results in long sequences that significantly increase computational costs. This issue is especially pronounced in transformer-based models, limiting the efficiency and scalability of processing binary data.
bGPT is equipped with a hierarchical structure designed to efficiently handle entire byte sequences. This structure segments a sequence of byte 
{{< katex >}}B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_T\}{{< /katex >}} of length {{< katex >}}T{{< /katex >}} into a sequence of patches {{< katex >}}\mathcal{P}{{< /katex >}}, where each patch contains exactly {{< katex >}}S{{< /katex >}} bytes:
{{< katex >}}\mathcal{P} = [P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_N]{{< /katex >}} where {{< katex >}}N = \left\lceil \frac{T}{S} \right\rceil{{< /katex >}} is the number of patches,

{{< katex >}}P_i = [b_{(i-1)S+1}, \ldots, b_{(i)S}]{{< /katex >}} for {{< katex >}}( 1 \leq i \leq N){{< /katex >}}, if {{< katex >}}T \mod S \neq 0{{< /katex >}}, the last patch defined as {{< katex >}}P_N = [b_{(N-1)S+1}, \ldots, b_T, \underbrace{e, \ldots, e}_{S - (T \mod S)}]{{< /katex >}} where {{< katex >}}e{{< /katex >}} represents the `<eop>` (end-of-patch).

***Components***


- **Linear Projection Layer**: Each byte patch is mapped to a high-dimensional feature space through a linear projection layer. During this process, each byte is encoded into a 257-dimensional vector, which includes the 256 possible byte values and a special `<eop>` (end-of-patch) token.
- **Patch-Level Decoder**: The embedded patches are processed by a patch-level decoder. This decoder plays a role in predicting the features of the next patch from the embedding of each patch, thereby learning the structural patterns of the entire dataset.
- **Byte-Level Decoder**: Based on the predicted patch features, the byte sequence within each patch is reconstructed. The byte-level decoder uses the features of each patch to predict the next byte within that patch, processing the detailed information of the entire byte sequence.


### Training Objectives

#### 1. Generative Modeling

This approach requires the model to predict the next byte in a given byte sequence. The model takes the byte sequence {{< katex >}}B = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_T\}{{< /katex >}} as input and utilizes all previous byte information to predict the next byte {{< katex >}}b_{i+1}{{< /katex >}} at each position.

As a loss function, the negative log likelihood of the next byte at each step is minimized. This encourages the model to maximize the likelihood of the actual occurrence of the next byte.
{{< katex >}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{GEN}}(\theta) = - \sum_{i=1}^{T-1} \log p(b_{i+1} \mid b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_i; \theta){{< /katex >}}


#### 2. Classification

Based on the knowledge acquired through generative modeling, bGPT can also be applied to classification tasks for labeled datasets. In this process, the model takes a byte sequence as input and predicts the category to which that sequence belongs.
For classification tasks, the loss function used is the cross-entropy loss, which ensures that the model accurately outputs the prediction probabilities for each category.

{{< katex >}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{CLF}}(\theta) = - \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_k \log p(y_k \mid B; \theta){{< /katex >}}


These training objectives enable bGPT to understand various byte-based data and accurately mimic digital patterns of the real world. The combination of generative approaches and classification capabilities grants the model the flexibility to tackle a diverse range of problems. Through this, the model can go beyond simple pattern recognition to play a crucial role in predicting and analyzing the operations of complex digital systems.

## Applications

### 1. Digital Media Processing

bGPT is used for processing various types of digital media data such as text, audio, and images. This model performs learning targeted at media files through generative modeling, transforming the data into features and subsequently performing classification tasks based on these features.

For example, audio files are converted to and processed in WAV format, while images are processed at a low resolution in BMP format. By utilizing these standardized datasets, bGPT can develop a generalized understanding of various media types.

### 2. Algorithm and Hardware Simulation

bGPT is particularly useful for tasks such as data conversion and CPU state modeling. This means bGPT can learn the digital conversion process and simulate the operation of CPUs to predict the state of the CPU after various commands are executed.

For example, in the task of converting the music data format from ABC notation to MIDI format, bGPT learns to transform text-based music scores in ABC notation into binary performance signals in MIDI. Additionally, this model is also capable of performing the reverse conversion from MIDI back to ABC notation.

## Experiments
